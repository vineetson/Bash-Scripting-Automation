### **üí° Why This Repo?**

In cloud infrastructure, a well-placed script can save you significant time and money. Our scripts leverage native GCP tools like **`gsutil`** to perform tasks directly and efficiently. They are simple to integrate into cron jobs, Cloud Functions, or CI/CD pipelines, making them a perfect choice for DevOps professionals and system administrators.

### **üîí IAM & Security**

Each script's **`README.md`** provides a detailed breakdown of the  **minimum required IAM permissions** . For all production workloads, it is strongly recommended to create a **custom IAM role** to follow the principle of least privilege, thereby minimizing your security footprint.
